Konqueror Plugins
=====================================================================
This module contains plugins that interact with Konqueror.

babelfish
-------------------
This works on KHTMLPart/KWebKitPart.  It uses Google to
translate the current page to whatever language you want (within
reason).

dirfilter
-------------------
This works on dolphin part.  This allows you to filter the current
directory in a variety of ways.

khtmlsettingsplugin
-------------------
This works on KHTMLPart.  This allows you to enable or disable a bunch
of HTML settings without going through the settings dialog.

kimgalleryplugin
-------------------
This works on a directory part.  It creates an HTML page with thumbnails of
all the images in the current directory.

uachanger
-------------------
This works on KHTMLPart/KWebKitPart.  It allows you to change the user agent
without going through the settings dialog.

autorefresh
-------------------
This works on any readonly part (though currently it only plugs into
khtmlpart/kwebkitpart). It lets you tell konqueror to refresh a page automatically
after a specific period. This is useful for things like news pages,
and should be very nice for people using kiosk mode.

fsview
-------------------
Graphical Disk Usage as konqueror plugin for inode/directory, for local files.

akregator
-------------------
This works on KHTMLPart/KWebKitPart and allows you to add feeds to Akregator directly from Konqueror.
